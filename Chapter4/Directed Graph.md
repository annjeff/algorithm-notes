### Directed Graph

In directed graphs, edges are one-way: the pair of vertices that defines each edge is an ordered pair that specifies a one-way adjacency. Many applications (for example, graphs that represent the web, scheduling constraints, or telephone calls) are naturally expressed in terms of directed graphs.

Typical digraph applications

#### Glossary

Our definitions for directed graphs are nearly identical to those for undirected graphs (as are some of the algorithms and programs that we use), but they are worth restating. The slight differences in the wording to account for edge directions imply structural properties that will be the focus of this section.

##### Definition

A directed graph (or digraph) is a set of vertices and a collection of directed edges. Each directed edge connects an ordered pair of vertices.

##### Definition

A directed path in a digraph is a sequence of vertices in which there is a (directed) edge pointing from each vertex in the sequence to its successor in the sequence. A directed cycle is a directed path with at least one edge whose first and last vertices are the same. A simple cycle is a cycle with no repeated edges or vertices (except the requisite repetition of the first and last vertices). The length of a path or a cycle is its number of edges.

#### Digraph data type

##### Representation

We use the a djacency-lists representation, where an edge v->w is represented as a list node containing w in the linked list corresponding to v. This representation is essentially the same as for undirected graphs but is even more straightforward because each edge occurs just once, as shown on the facing page.

##### Input format

The code for the constructor that takes a digraph from an input stream is identical to the corresponding constructor in Graphâ€”the input format is the same, but all edges are interpreted to be directed edges. In the list-of-edges format, a pair v w is interpreted as an edge v->w.

##### Reversing a digraph

Digraph also adds to the API a method reverse() which returns a copy of the digraph, with all edges reversed. This method is sometimes needed in digraph processing because it allows clients to find the edges that point to each vertex, while adj() gives just vertices connected by edges that point from each vertex.

##### Symbolic names

It is also a simple matter to allow clients to use symbolic names in
digraph applications. To implement a class SymbolDigraph like SymbolGraph on page 552, replace Graph by Digraph everywhere.

```
public class Digraph {
	private final int V;
	private int E;
	private Bag<Integer> adj;

	public Digraph(int V) {
		this.V=V;
		this.E=0;
		adj=(Bag<Integer>[])new Bag[V];
		for(int v=0;v<V;v++) {
			adj[v]=new Bag<Integer>();
		}
	}
	
	public int V() {
		return V;
	}
	
	public int E() {
		return E;
	}
	
	public void addEdge(int v,int w) {
		adj[v].add(w);
		E++;
	}
	
	public Iterable<Integer> adj(int v){
		return adj[v];
	}
	
	public Digraph reverse() {
		Digraph R=new Digraph(V);
		for(int v=0;v<V;v++) {
			for(int w:adj(v)) {
				R.addEdge(w, v);
			}
		}
		
		return R;
	}
}
```

#### Reachability in digraphs

Single-source reachability. Given a digraph and a source vertex s, support queries of the form Is there a directed path from s to a given target vertex v?

Multiple-source reachability. Given a digraph and a set of source vertices, support queries of the form Is there a directed path from any vertex in the set to a given target vertex v?

DirectedDFS uses our standard graph-processing paradigm and a standard recursive depth-first search to solve these problems. It calls the recursive dfs() for each source, which marks every vertex encountered. 

##### Proposition D.

DFS marks all the vertices in a digraph reachable from a given set of sources in time proportional to the sum of the outdegrees of the vertices marked.

```
public class DirectedDFS {

	private boolean[] marked;
	
	public DirectedDFS(Digraph G, int s) {
		marked=new boolean[G.V()];
		dfs(G,s);
	}
	
	public DirectedDFS(Digraph G, Iterable<Integer> sources) {
		marked=new boolean[G.V()];
		for(int s:sources) {
			if(!marked[s])
				dfs(G,s);
		}
	}
	
	private void dfs(Digraph G,int v) {
		marked[v]=true;
		for(int w:G.adj(v)) {
			if(!marked[w]) {
				dfs(G,w);
			}
		}
	}
	
	public boolean marked(int v) {
		return marked[v];
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Digraph G=new Digraph(new In(args));
		
		Bag<Integer> sources=new Bag<Integer>();
		for(int i=1;i<args.length;i++) {
			source.add(Integer.parseInt(args[i]));
		}
		DirectedDFS reachable=new DirectedDFS(G,sources);
		for(int v=0;v<G.V();v++) {
			if(reachable.marked(v)) {
				StdOut.print(v+" ");
			}
		}
		StdOut.println();
	}
}
```

##### Mark-and-sweep garbage collection

An important application of multiple-source reachability is found in typical memory-management systems, including many implementations of Java.

##### Finding paths in digraphs.

Single-source directed paths. Given a digraph and a source vertex s, support queries of the form Is there a directed path from s to a given target vertex v? If so, find such a path.
Single-source shortest directed paths. Given a digraph and a source vertex s, support queries of the form Is there a directed path from s to a given target vertex v? If so, find a shortest such path (one with a minimal number of edges).

#### Cycles and DAGs

Directed cycles are of particular importance in applications that involve processing digraphs. Identifying directed cycles in a typical digraph can be a challenge without the help of a computer, as shown at right.

##### Scheduling problems

A widely applicable problem-solving model has to do with arranging for the completion of a set of jobs, under a set of constraints, by specifying when and how the jobs are to be performed.

Precedence-constrained scheduling. Given a set of jobs to be completed, with precedence constraints that specify that certain jobs have to be completed before certain other jobs are begun, how can we schedule the jobs such that they are all completed while still respecting the constraints?

Topological sort. Given a digraph, put the vertices in order such that all its directed edges point from a vertex earlier in the order to a vertex later in the order (or report that doing so is not possible).

        <th>application</th>
        <th>vertex</th>
        <th>edge</th>

Typical topological-sort applications

##### Cycles in digraphs

If job x must be completed before job y, job y before job z, and job z before job x, then someone has made a mistake, because those three constraints cannot all be satisfied. In general, if a precedence-constrained scheduling problem has a directed cycle, then there is no feasible solution.

Directed cycle detection. Does a given digraph have a directed cycle? If so, find the vertices on some such cycle, in order from some vertex back to itself.

##### Definition

A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a digraph with no directed cycles.

```
public class DirectedCycle {

	private boolean[] marked;
	private int[] edgeTo;
	private Stack<Integer> cycle;
	private boolean[] onStack;
	
	public DirectedCycle(Graph G) {
		onStack=new boolean[G.V()];
		edgeTo=new int[G.V()];
		marked=new boolean[G.V()];
		for(int v=0;v<G.V();v++){
			if(!marked[v])
				dfs(G,v);
		}
	}
	
	private void dfs(Digraph G, int v) {
		onStack[v]=true;
		marked[v]=true;
		for(int w:G.adj(v)) {
			if(this.hasCycle())
				return;
			else if(!marked[w]) {
				edgeTo[w]=v;
				dfs(G,w);
			}else if(onStack[w]) {
				cycle=new Stack<Integer>();
				for(int x=v;x!=w;x++) {
					cycle.push(x);
				}
				cycle.push(w);
				cycle.push(v);
			}
		}
		onStack[v]=false;
	}
	
	public boolean hasCycle() {
		return cycle!=null;
	}
	
	public Iterable<Integer> cycle(){
		return cycle;
	}
}
```

##### Depth-first orders and topological sort

Precedence-constrained scheduling amounts to computing a topological order for the vertices of a DAG.

##### Proposition E

A digraph has a topological order if and only if it is a DAG.

Three vertex orderings are of interest in typical applications:

* Preorder : Put the vertex on a queue before the recursive calls.
* Postorder : Put the vertex on a queue after the recursive calls.
* Reverse postorder : Put the vertex on a stack after the recursive calls.

```
public class DepthFirstOrder {

	private boolean[] marked;
	
	private Queue<Integer> pre;
	private Queue<Integer> post;
	private Stack<Integer> reversePost;
	
	public DepthFirstOrder(Digraph G) {
		pre=new Queue<Integer>();
		post=new Queue<Integer>();
		reversePost=new Stack<Integer>();
		marked=new boolean[G.V()];
		
		for(int v=0;v<G.V();v++) {
			if(!marked[v])
				dfs(G,v);
		}
	}
	
	private void dfs(Digraph G, int v) {
		pre.enqueue(v);
		
		marked[v]=true;
		for(int w:G.adj(v))
			if(!marked[w]) {
				dfs(G,v);
			}
		
		post.enqueue(v);
		reversePost.push(v);
	}
	
	public Iterable<Integer> pre(){
		return pre;
	}
	
	public Iterable<Integer> post(){
		return post;
	}
	
	public Iterable<Integer> reversePost(){
		return reversePost;
	}
}
```

```
public class Topological {
	
	private Iterable<Integer> order;
	
	public Topological(Digraph G) {
		DirectedCycle cyclefinder=new DirectedCycle(G);
		if(!cyclefinder.hasCycle()) {
			DepthFirstOrder dfs=new DepthFirstOrder(G);
			order=dfs.reversePost();
		}
	}
	
	public Iterable<Integer> order(){
		return order;
	}
	
	public boolean isDAG() {
		return order==null;
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		String filename=args[0];
		String separator=args[1];
		SymbolDigraph sg=new SymbolDigraph(filename,separator);
		
		Topological top=new Topological(sg.G());
		
		for(int v;top.order()) {
			StdOut.println(sg.name(v));
		}
	}

}
```

##### Proposition F

Reverse postorder in a DAG is a topological sort.

##### Proposition G

With DFS, we can topologically sort a DAG in time proportional to V+E.

A job-scheduling application is typically a three-step process:

* Specify the tasks and precedence constraints.
* Make sure that a feasible solution exists, by detecting and removing cycles in the underlying digraph until none exist.
* Solve the scheduling problem, using topological sort.

#### Strong connectivity in digraphs

We have been careful to maintain a distinction between reachability in digraphs and connectivity in undirected graphs. In an undirected graph, two vertices v and w are connected if there is a path connecting themâ€”we can use that path to get from v to w or to get from w to v. In a digraph, by contrast, a vertex w is reachable from a vertex v if there is a directed path from v to w, but there may or may not be a directed path back to v from w.

##### Definition

Two vertices v and w are strongly connected if they are mutually reachable: that is, if there is a directed path from v to w and a directed path from w to v. A digraph is strongly connected if all its vertices are strongly connected to one another.

###### Strong components

Like connectivity in undirected graphs, strong connectivity in digraphs is an equivalence relation on the set of vertices, as it has the following properties:

* Reflexive : Every vertex v is strongly connected to itself.
* Symmetric : If v is strongly connected to w, then w is strongly connected to v.
* Transitive : If v is strongly connected to w and w is strongly connected to x, then v is also strongly connected to x.
As an equivalence relation, strong connectivity partitions the vertices into equivalence clasees.

##### Examples of applications

Strong connectivity is a useful abstraction in understanding the structure of a digraph, highlighting interrelated sets of vertices (strong components).

Typical strong-component applications

##### Kosarajuâ€™s algorithm

We saw in CC (Algorithm 4.3 on page 544) that computing connected components in undirected graphs is a simple application of depth-first search. The implementation KosarajuSCC on the facing page does the job with just a few lines of code added to CC, as follows:

* Given a digraph G, use DepthFirstOrder to compute the reverse postorder of its reverse, ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?G^R).
* Run standard DFS on G, but consider the unmarked vertices in the order just computed instead of the standard numerical order.
* All vertices reached on a call to the recursive dfs() from the constructor are in a strong component (!), so identify them as in CC.

```
public class KosarajuSCC {
	
	private boolean[] marked;
	private int[] id;
	private int count;
	
	public KosarajuSCC(Digraph G) {
		marked=new boolean[G.V()];
		id=new int[G.V()];
		DepthFirstOrder order=new DepthFirstOrder(G.reverse());
		for(int s:order.reversePost()) {
			if(!marked[s]) {
				dfs(G,s);
				count++;
			}
		}
	}
	
	private void dfs(Digraph G, int v) {
		marked[v]=true;
		id[v]=count;
		for(int w:G.adj(v)) {
			if(!marked[w]) {
				dfs(G,w);
			}
		}
	}
	
	public boolean stronglyConnected(int v, int w) {
		return id[v]==id[w];
	}
	
	public int id(int v) {
		return id[v];
	}
	
	public int count() {
		return count;
	}

}
```

###### Proposition H

In a DFS of a digraph G where marked vertices are considered in reverse postorder given by a DFS of the digraphâ€™s reverse G R (Kosarajuâ€™s algorithm), the vertices reached in each call of the recursive method from the constructor are in a strong component.

Strong connectivity. Given a digraph, support queries of the form: Are two given vertices strongly connected ? and How many strong components does the digraph have ?

##### Proposition I

Kosarajuâ€™s algorithm uses preprocessing time and space proportional to V+E to support constant-time strong connectivity queries in a digraph.

###### Reachability revisited

With CC for undirected graphs, we can infer from the fact that two vertices v and w are connected that there is a path from v to w and a path (the same one) from w to v.

All-pairs reachability. Given a digraph, support queries of the form Is there a directed path from a given vertex v to another given vertex w?

##### Definition.

The transitive closure of a digraph G is another digraph with the same set of vertices, but with an edge from v to w in the transitive closure if and only if w is reachable from v in G.
