## Study for Algorithm

The main reference book is MIT *Introduction to Algorithm*.

And I also read some materials and watch the videos which is the open course of this book.

If you are a student for self study, I suggest you should have some practical experience in programming for a year.

If you are a student for Computer Science, you can study and follow this respository at once.

I have worked for a year, and now can partially understand the open courses. So I decide to take some notes for improvement.

The videos of Introduction to Algorithm have been updated. Please visit:

## Reference book:

*Algorithm 4th Edition*. It could be easier understanding than *Introduction to Algorithm*.
