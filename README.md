Study for Algorithm

The main reference book is MIT *Introduction to Algorithm*.

And I also read some materials and watch the videos which is the open course of this book.

If you are a student for self study, I suggest you should have some practical experice in programming for a year.

If you are a student for Computer Science, you can study and fellow this respository at once.

I have worked for a year, and now can partially understand the open course. So I decide to take some notes for improvement.
